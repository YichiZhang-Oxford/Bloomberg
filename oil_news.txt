Day 1 (July 19, 2024):

Oil prices fell today, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropping 0.8% to $82.50 per barrel and Brent crude decreasing 0.9% to $85.10 per barrel. The decline was attributed to a rise in U.S. oil production, which exacerbated fears of an oversupply. Recent data revealed an increase in U.S. rig counts and output, challenging the efforts of OPEC+ to stabilize the market through production cuts. Although global demand remains relatively stable, the increase in U.S. supply contributed to market uncertainties. Additionally, mixed economic signals from key markets added to the volatility. Traders are concerned that the growing U.S. production could offset the impacts of OPEC+ cuts, leading to potential imbalances. Geopolitical tensions, particularly in oil-rich regions, remain a backdrop but did not significantly influence today’s price action. Analysts are watching closely to see if this trend continues and how it might affect the balance between supply and demand.

Day 2 (July 20, 2024):

Oil prices rebounded strongly today, with WTI rising 1.4% to $83.80 per barrel and Brent up 1.2% to $86.20 per barrel. This increase was driven by a substantial drop in U.S. oil inventories, which indicated stronger-than-expected domestic demand. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a significant drawdown in stockpiles, easing concerns about oversupply and supporting higher prices. Furthermore, OPEC+ compliance with production cuts continued to tighten global supply. Positive economic data, including higher industrial output and increased transportation fuel consumption, bolstered the market. Despite these positive indicators, traders remain cautious about potential fluctuations in production levels and broader economic conditions. The rebound reflects renewed optimism that demand is resilient and supply constraints are effective. However, market participants are vigilant about potential supply disruptions and geopolitical developments that could influence future price movements.

Day 3 (July 21, 2024):

Oil prices extended their gains today, with WTI crude climbing 1.6% to $85.00 per barrel and Brent crude increasing 1.4% to $87.80 per barrel. The market’s positive momentum was fueled by improved economic indicators and sustained confidence in oil demand. Reports showed robust industrial activity and higher-than-expected fuel consumption, which supported the rise in prices. Additionally, OPEC+ members continued their commitment to production cuts, contributing to a tighter supply environment. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also played a role, as concerns about potential supply disruptions provided upward pressure. Despite the bullish sentiment, analysts warned of potential volatility due to uncertainties around future production levels and economic shifts.

The decline was driven by mixed economic signals and concerns about a temporary oversupply. Data indicated a minor increase in U.S. oil production, raising worries about potential imbalances between supply and demand. Although global demand remains strong, the uptick in U.S. output contributed to market uncertainty. Additionally, there were concerns about the pace of economic recovery, with some indicators showing weaker-than-expected growth. OPEC+ efforts to manage supply through production cuts are ongoing, but the market is sensitive to any changes in production levels or economic conditions.
