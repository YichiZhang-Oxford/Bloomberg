-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [commodity, price, date, supply, demand, location, event, market_indicator, market_participant, market_behavior]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>){record_delimiter}

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity

Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>){record_delimiter}

3, Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is English. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. If you have to translate, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

 and robust demand. Despite the steady prices, uncertainties about future economic conditions and production policies continue to influence market sentiment. Overall, today’s stability highlights the complexities driving the oil market.

Day 9 (July 27, 2024):

Oil prices surged today, with WTI crude increasing 1.5% to $87.00 per barrel and Brent crude rising 1.4% to $89.20 per barrel. The significant rise was driven by an upward revision in global demand forecasts and positive economic indicators. The International Energy Agency (IEA) adjusted its demand outlook, citing stronger-than-expected consumption in industrial and transportation sectors. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply constraints from major oil-producing countries contributed to the bullish sentiment. Reports of reduced production from key regions and concerns about potential supply disruptions supported higher prices. Despite the optimism, analysts caution about potential volatility due to uncertainties regarding future production levels and economic shifts. The oil market continues to experience heightened activity, with strong demand and managed supply driving current price movements. Traders remain vigilant for any developments that could impact future price trends.

Day 10 (July 28, 2024):

Oil prices experienced a slight retreat today, with WTI crude falling 1.2% to $85.40 per barrel and Brent crude decreasing 1.1% to $88.20 per barrel. The decline was attributed to profit-taking following recent gains and ongoing concerns about future supply and demand dynamics. Despite a positive demand outlook, the market is cautious about potential changes in production levels and geopolitical risks. Recent reports suggested that while global demand remains strong, uncertainties about future economic conditions and possible shifts in production policies contribute to market volatility. Traders are closely monitoring these factors as they assess the balance between supply constraints and demand growth. The oil market continues to navigate a complex environment, with current price movements reflecting a delicate equilibrium between strong demand forecasts and potential supply disruptions. As always, market participants remain alert for any developments that could influence future price trends.

Day 1 (July 19, 2024):

Oil prices fell today, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropping 0.8% to $82.50 per barrel and Brent crude decreasing 0.9% to $85.10 per barrel. The decline was attributed to a rise in U.S. oil production, which exacerbated fears of an oversupply. Recent data revealed an increase in U.S. rig counts and output, challenging the efforts of OPEC+ to stabilize the market through production cuts. Although global demand remains relatively stable, the increase in U.S. supply contributed to market uncertainties. Additionally, mixed economic signals from key markets added to the volatility. Traders are concerned that the growing U.S. production could offset the impacts of OPEC+ cuts, leading to potential imbalances. Geopolitical tensions, particularly in oil-rich regions, remain a backdrop but did not significantly influence today’s price action. Analysts are watching closely to see if this trend continues and how it might affect the balance between supply and demand.

Day 2 (July 20, 2024):

Oil prices rebounded strongly today, with WTI rising 1.4% to $83.80 per barrel and Brent up 1.2% to $86.20 per barrel. This increase was driven by a substantial drop in U.S. oil inventories, which indicated stronger-than-expected domestic demand. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a significant drawdown in stockpiles, easing concerns about oversupply and supporting higher prices. Furthermore, OPEC+ compliance with production cuts continued to tighten global supply. Positive economic data, including higher industrial output and increased transportation fuel consumption, bolstered the market. Despite these positive indicators, traders remain cautious about potential fluctuations in production levels and broader economic conditions. The rebound reflects renewed optimism that demand is resilient and supply constraints are effective. However, market participants are vigilant about potential supply disruptions and geopolitical developments that could influence future price movements.

Day 3 (July 21, 2024):

Oil prices extended their gains today, with WTI crude climbing 1.6% to $85.00 per barrel and Brent crude increasing 1.4% to $87.80 per barrel. The market’s positive momentum was fueled by improved economic indicators and sustained confidence in oil demand. Reports showed robust industrial activity and higher-than-expected fuel consumption, which supported the rise in prices. Additionally, OPEC
